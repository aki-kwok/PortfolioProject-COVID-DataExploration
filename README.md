<H1>Worldwide COVID-19 Deaths Dashboard</H1>

<H2>Project Overview</H2>
The COVID-19 Deaths Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization project aimed at presenting a detailed analysis of the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the last 4 years (2020 - 2024). 
</br>
</br>
The primary objective is to offer insights into the spread and mortality rates associated with the virus. The dashboard consists of four key visualizations: Global Numbers (Total Cases, Total Deaths, and Death Percentage), Total Deaths per Continent (Bar Chart), Percent Population Infected per Country (Map View), and Average Percent Population Infected by Year. An important feature of this dashboard is its interactivity, allowing users to filter data by country, providing a customized view of the pandemic’s impact.

<H2>Process</H2>

<H3>Data Exploration with SQL</H3>
The data for this project was sourced from the Our World In Data COVID-19 dataset. During the exploration phase, a variety of SQL techniques were employed including Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Temporary Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, and Creation of Views, along with Converting Data Types. 
</br>
</br>
A challenge encountered was the varied grouping of countries in the dataset, some by continent and others by income level (categories like 'Low Income', 'Lower Middle Income', 'Upper Middle Income', and 'High Income'). This disparity in grouping was explored using SQL to ensure accurate representation and analysis.

<H3>Data Visualization with Tableau</H3>
The visualizations were chosen based on their intuitive nature and effectiveness in conveying complex data. 
</br>
</br>
A map was used to depict the percent population infected per country, a bar chart for total deaths per continent, and a line graph to show the average percent population infected by year. 
</br>
</br>
Tableau's robust features facilitated the creation of these interactive visualizations, making the complex data more comprehensible and accessible. The visualizations particularly excelled in illustrating a clear comparative view of infections and deaths across different countries.

<H2>Tools</H2>
• DB Brower for SQLite
</br>
• Tableau Public

<H2>Outcome</H2>
The COVID-19 Deaths Dashboard reveals critical insights into the pandemic's global impact. 
</br>
</br>
Key findings include:
</br>
</br>
• Variation in death rates across continents
</br>
• Disparity in infection rates among countries
</br>
• Fluctuation of infection rates over time 
</br>
</br>
These results are invaluable for policymakers, health professionals, and researchers in understanding the pandemic’s dynamics and strategizing future health interventions. The dashboard also serves as an informative tool for the general public, enhancing awareness and understanding of COVID-19’s global footprint. 
While the project met its primary objectives, further analysis could uncover more nuanced insights, particularly in the realms of socio-economic impacts and long-term trends of the pandemic.
